          The short version of my story is this: I’m a career-switcher, having
          started my working life in the languages industry before landing a
          role as a Pega Apprentice and getting promoted to a Pega Developer one
          year later. I loved learning languages (and still do!) because I’m a
          big fan of grammar rules (the first clue that maybe I’d enjoy coding),
          but I struggled to find a job in the languages industry that was the
          right fit for me.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          After discovering that I enjoyed coding, I taught myself HTML, CSS and
          JavaScript using Codecademy and worked hard at networking. I went to
          in-person events, arranged shadowing in a tech team, joined an online
          programme for women in tech and worked with a mentor to improve my CV
          and prepare for interviews.<br></br>
          <br></br>I applied for mainly apprenticeships and grad schemes, as
          well as a few junior roles. I had mixed results but eventually, in
          January 2024, I accepted an offer as a Pega Apprentice. I started the
          role in February along with seven others and we embarked upon the
          journey of learning the low-code system of Pega!<br></br>
          <br></br>
          Outside of work, I still think of myself as a linguist. I keep up with
          German, Spanish and Italian through Netflix/books/chatting to friends,
          and I’ve recently started Norwegian on Duolingo! I’m also a keen salsa
          and bachata dancer and spend many a weekend travelling to different
          cities to go to dance classes. Last but not least I volunteer with
          Girlguiding, working towards their mission “helping all girls know
          they can do anything”.<br></br>
          <br></br>
