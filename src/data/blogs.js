      "This is something I worked on last year that I never got round to sharing. I had the idea to create a Secret Santa generator. I wanted to do it as a webpage, where users could enter all names then press a button to generate the list. The idea was to only display matches one by one by clicking each name, to keep everyone's assignment secret. <br><br> I created the basic code in JavaScript then had to put the project on hold when I started preparing for job interviews, and then firmly back on the shelf once I started my new job. <br><br>But, despite the project not being quite what I envisioned, I still want to share the code I did write. It took a lot of refining but I was pleased I could figure out a way to do it, and it was a good chance to practise recursion, too - something I'd been learning about in preparation for job applications.

I used Redux to manage the state in this app, though I now realise it would be better to use local state, except when changes in one component affects another. This was also the first project where I implemented testing, and I’ve discovered the value of writing tests early! <br><br>The project is unfinished, because I realised there is a lot that could be done better, and if I were to continue working on it I’d rather start from scratch to implement everything I learnt from Jade, but I’m proud of the work I did so still wanted to share it in my blog.

On first loading, the page view defaults to show posts from the r/popular subreddit. Users can then view that data, or change it by clicking on some predefined subreddits, or entering a search term. Users can click on an item from the list of results and it will take them to a more detailed view of the post, including comments. <br>This project was created using React and Redux as a way to practise key skills, including async thunks to fetch data and a store to manage state. CSS is used for styling, including animations during the loading state. <br><br>Challenges involved working out the best way to consistently display data, especially considering some posts had thumbnails only, some had better quality pictures, some had videos, and some had no images at all. I decided on using if/else statements to render something different depending on what the data was, but this may not be the best approach. Another challenge was that the sound does not play in the videos. This problem was also faced by other learners completing the same project.
