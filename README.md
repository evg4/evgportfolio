## Title
Portfolio

## Description 
This portfolio was built with React, after my previous one (see https://evgportfolio.netlify.app/projects/Portfolio) was no longer fit for purpose as I added more and more projects. The idea behind rebuilding with React was that I could easily add new projects by making use of reusable components. I also added a separate Blog page, where I can document my learnings and smaller projects, keeping the Projects page for more significant work.
As usual, I found the design hard and, despite doing a plan at the beginning, made a lot of changes as I went when I realised what I'd envisioned wasn't quite working. There are things I could still improve on (such as more unified break points for responsiveness; more consistency with size of images used in the blog posts etc), but I've been working on this for a while now alongside other projects and would rather deploy it in a "good enough" state.
